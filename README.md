## How To Use

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/leomleao/leo

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# If on dev, create a .env in the root folder with your DATABASE_URL in the following format: postgres://USER:PASS@HOST:PORT/DB

# Load data to DB
$ npm run setdb

# Run the app
$ npm start
```

Tests can be performed by simply running:

```bash
# Run the app
$ npm test
```

I'm not sure rather coding speed was a very important thing here, but anyway, you guys will be able to judge that on the following two links:

Note: It's split in two, because I separated my account from home and office. Btw if you guys don't know, [WAKATIME](https://wakatime.com) is very fun tool.
